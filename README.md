## About us (SixtyFPS GmbH)

We are passionate about software - API design, cross-platform software
development and user interface components. Our aim is to make developing user
interfaces fun for everyone: from Python, JavaScript, C++, or Rust developers all the
way to UI/UX designers. We believe that software grows organically and keeping
it open source is the best way to sustain that growth. Our team members are
located remotely in Germany, Finland, and the US.
